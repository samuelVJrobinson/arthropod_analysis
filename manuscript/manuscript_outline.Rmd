# Introduction

* Arthropod diversity is important to understand in agricultural systems
  + Pests can cause large amounts of damage
  + Beneficial insects can offset this
  + Important for global biodiversity - insects may be declining globally
  + Agriculture is ~36% of land worldwide
  + Potential for win-win scenarios
  
* We don't have a good understanding of what drives arthropod abundance
  + Bees are generally driven by flower/nest abundance
  + Limited understanding of other arthropods
  + Beetles are limited by water, food, oviposition sites, etc.
  + Arachnids are similarly limited by food, shelter
  
* Landscape structure can influence abundance of beneficial arthropods in agricultural areas
  + No-till agriculture 
  + How can we design landscapes to benefit both farmers and insects?
  
* Point estimates of abundance are influenced by spatio-temporal processes 
  + Arthropods move between landscape components depending on their life history
  + e.g. Carabid beetles are thought to reproduce in field margins, but adults feed in fields (Desender and Alderweireldt 1988, J. of App. Ent.)
  + Counts are a proxy of activity density, not necessarily abundance
  + Nevertheless, this is an OK measure (_need to justify this_)
  
* In this study, we used pitfall trap counts of three species of beneficial arthropod to determine how landscape composition affects activity density of arthropods
  + We hypothesized that:
  1. Abundance of semi-natural land would result in increased arthropod abundance
  2. Other things...

# Methods

* We used a system of pitfall traps located in southern Alberta in 2017

# Results

# Discussion
