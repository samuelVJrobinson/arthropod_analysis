# Introduction

* Arthropod diversity is important to understand in agricultural systems
  + Pests can cause large amounts of damage
  + Beneficial insects can offset this
  + Important for global biodiversity - insects may be declining globally
  + Agriculture is ~36% of land worldwide
  + Potential for win-win scenarios
  
* We don't have a good understanding of what drives arthropod abundance
  + Bees are generally driven by flower/nest abundance
  + Limited understanding of other arthropods
  + Beetles are limited by water, food, oviposition sites, etc.
  + Arachnids are similarly limited by food, shelter
  
* Landscape structure can influence abundance of beneficial arthropods in agricultural areas
  + No-till agriculture 
  + How can we design landscapes to benefit both farmers and insects?
  
* Point estimates of abundance are influenced by spatio-temporal processes 
  + Arthropods move between landscape components depending on their life history
  + e.g. Carabid beetles are thought to reproduce in field margins, but adults feed in fields (Desender and Alderweireldt 1988, J. of App. Ent.)
  + Counts are a proxy of activity density, not necessarily abundance
  + Nevertheless, this is probably an OK measure (_need to justify this_)
  
* In this study, we used pitfall trap counts of three species of beneficial arthropod to determine how landscape composition affects activity density of arthropods
  + We hypothesized that:
  1. Abundance of semi-natural land would result in increased arthropod abundance
  2. Other things...

# Methods

##Data collection

* We used a system of pitfall traps installed in ditches, field margins, wetlands, and in-field sites across southern Alberta in 2017 (_need a map here_)
  + Traps at in-field sites were installed 20, 100, 200m (?) along a transect from the nearest non-crop feature (wetland, grassland, pivot)
  + 
  
* To characterize landscape composition surrounding the traps, we used classified landscape data from AAFC
  + Classifications are very accurate for fields (~90%), but less accurate for non-crop areas (~70%)
  + Landscape studies often use the landscape composition within a circle of a fixed radius surrounding each point
  + However, the radius of the circle depends on the grain of the landscape that is relevant to the abundance of a given organism.
  + We used a novel method 
  + Instead, we divided the landscape into annuli (rings) surrounding each trap location.
  + Each annulus was 30 m thick, and had inner radii ranging from 30 to 1470m, in increments of 30m.
