Driving questions:

- Do certain landscape features act as refugia for benefical arthropods? What types of arthropods live where?
- Do arthropods spill over into crop fields from non-crop areas? How far does this extend?
- How do lags in landcape composition (last year's planting) effect arthropod density?

Hypothesis:
- Non-crop areas are not disturbed (as frequently) as cropland, acting as suitable egg-laying and feeding sites
- Crop areas are disturbed (egg-laying not as successful), but act as feeding sites because pest insects aggregate to them
Preditions:
- Predatory arthropod abundance will be high in non-crop areas and low in crop areas
  - Specifically, abundance will be higher in areas with abundance (nearby) non-crop area

General notes:
- Lang 2000: Seems like pitfall traps are not a good measure of density, by themselves. Sampling radius depends on time, ground cover, etc.
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02956438
  - Zhao et al 2013: However, there are methods to address this, namely 2-trap method:

- Wissinger 1997: what traits make certain organisms good at "cyclic recolonization"? Seems like a good review paper

- Gardiner et al 2010: pitfall trap catches in soybean fields, but studied spiders, carabids, and harvestmen
  - spiders increased in response to forest and grasslands; carabids strongly influenced by single species
  - for carabids, relationships with landscape variables are taxon-specific (agricultural vs perennial specializations)
    - can depend on overwintering as larvae vs adults
  - Lycosid abundance higher near grasslands, Lyniphiid abundance higher near forests

Phalangium opilo:

  Food preferences:

  - Newton and Yeargan 2002: very abundant in soybeans/alfalfa
  https://academic.oup.com/ee/article-abstract/31/1/92/377653
  - Edgar and Yuan 1968: likely nocturnal foragers - very active compared to other harvestmen
   https://www.jstor.org/stable/4606863 
  - Allard and Yeargan 2005: do better feeding on caterpillars than aphids, but can eat either
    - Lots of diet refs in Introduction
    https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-34.1.6
  - Allard and Yeargan 2005(b): nocturnal foragers, tend to rest on plants during the day, but move to the ground at night

  https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.2478/s11756-006-0027-7.pdf
  - Sajna et al 2011: seems like P. opilio chooses habitats mainly based on humidity, less so on temperature; avoid grazed turf during high temperatures
    - dominant in understory? - not written very well, so hard to tell

  - Van de Poel 2015 MSc: P. opilio found in "intensively used" landscapes
    - sample direction (direction of trapping) doesn't matter for most Opiliones, but it does for P. opilio (more found in traps facing the forest); migration between habitats?
    - found a lot at forest edges, rather than in centre of forests
    - sampling is unclear; looks like only 1 sample per location (4 pitfall traps)

Concurvity: originally defined by Buja et al. 1989 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2241560)
Very few examples of how to deal with concurvity properly
  - Some suggest threshold of 0.5 as a cutoff (https://www.jstor.org/stable/3703274, https://doi.org/10.3832/ifor2620-012 )
  - Others seem to think it's not much of a problem, as long as convergence is achieved, eg:

    - https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/issues.html#Concurvity
    - https://jroy042.github.io/nonlinear/week3.html
  - Wood's approach isn't very helpful; I suspect he doesn't have a solution to the problem. Not mentioned in GAM 2nd ed, but briefly mentioned in some lectures
