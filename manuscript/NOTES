Driving questions:

- Do certain landscape features act as refugia for benefical arthropods? What types of arthropods live where?
- Do arthropods spill over into crop fields from non-crop areas? How far does this extend?
- How do lags in landcape composition (last year's planting) effect arthropod density?

Hypothesis:
- Non-crop areas are not disturbed (as frequently) as cropland, acting as suitable egg-laying and feeding sites
- Crop areas are disturbed (egg-laying not as successful), but act as feeding sites because pest insects aggregate to them
Preditions:
- Predatory arthropod abundance will be high in non-crop areas and low in crop areas
  - Specifically, abundance will be higher in areas with abundance (nearby) non-crop area

- Lang 2000: Seems like pitfall traps are not a good measure of density, by themselves. Sampling radius depends on time, ground cover, etc.

Phalangium opilo:

Concurvity: originally defined by Buja et al. 1989 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2241560)
Very few examples of how to deal with concurvity properly
  - Some suggest threshold of 0.5 as a cutoff (https://www.jstor.org/stable/3703274, https://doi.org/10.3832/ifor2620-012 )
  - Others seem to think it's not much of a problem, as long as convergence is achieved, eg:

    - https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/issues.html#Concurvity
    - https://jroy042.github.io/nonlinear/week3.html
  - Wood's approach isn't very helpful; I suspect he doesn't have a solution to the problem. Not mentioned in GAM 2nd ed, but briefly mentioned in some lectures
