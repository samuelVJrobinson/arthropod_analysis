  abstract  = {Recent declines of bee species have led to great interest in preserving and promoting bee populations for agricultural and wild plant pollination. Many correlational studies have examined the indirect effects of factors such as landscape context and land management practices and found great variation in bee response. We focus here on the evidence for effects of direct factors (i.e., food resources, nesting resources, and incidental risks) regulating bee populations and then interpret varied responses to indirect factors through their species-specific and habitat-specific effects on direct factors. We find strong evidence for food resource availability regulating bee populations, but little clear evidence that other direct factors are commonly limiting. We recommend manipulative experiments to illuminate the effects of these different factors. We contend that much of the variation in impact from indirect factors, such as grazing, can be explained by the relationships between indirect factors and floral resource availability based on environmental circumstances.},

Our knowledge about carabids is biased toward species living in north-temperate regions. Most carabids are predatory, consume a wide range of food types, and experience food shortages in the field. Feeding on both plant and animal material and scavenging are probably more significant than currently acknowledged. The most important mortality sources are abiotic factors and predators; pathogens and parasites can be important for some developmental stages. Although competition among larvae and adults does occur, the importance of competition as a community organization is not proven. Carabids are abundant in agricultural fields all over the world and may be important natural enemies of agricultural pests.},

  abstract  = {An important goal of ecological compensation areas (ECAs) is to increase biodiversity in adjacent intensively managed farmland and the agricultural landscape at large. We tested whether this goal can be achieved in the case of the agri-environmental restoration scheme implemented for Swiss grassland using five large arthropod taxa (bees, true bugs, orthopterans, ground beetles and spiders) representing different ecological and functional groups. The species richness and abundance of all groups and species, respectively, was measured along 100m transects from ECA-meadows into the adjacent intensively managed grassland at 24 sites. Species richness of all arthropod taxa except ground beetles, and the abundance of 63% of the 234 arthropod species sampled with at least five individuals were higher in ECA-meadows than in their surroundings, while the total abundance of spiders and ground beetles was higher in intensively managed meadows. The abundance of 8% of these species were only increased in the ECA-meadows themselves (“stenotopic” species) but 40% had increased abundance both in the ECA-meadows and the adjacent grassland, declining exponentially with increasing distance from ECA-meadows (“edge species”). The 90%-decay distances for these edge species differed among taxonomic groups (117±18m for true bugs, 137±24m for spiders, 152±34m for bees, 167±5.7m for orthopterans, 185±34m for ground beetles; mean ±1 standard error) and independent of taxonomic group were larger for large-sized or predacious species than for small-sized or phytophagous species. Because the average distance between neighbouring ECA-meadows in Swiss grassland is only 73±4m, the current agri-environment scheme very likely enhances arthropod diversity and possibly associated ecosystem services in the Swiss agricultural landscape at large.},

An attempt is made to evaluate the role of the field edges as a refuge and/or reproduction site for these predatory beetles.

Reproduction, as deduced from the occurrence of an increased larval density, is not limited to the plot centre, but for some “field” species seems to take place in the boundary too. The data on some other species support the idea that field boundaries are important as hibernation refuges for ground beetles.},

  abstract = {In an agroecosystem, catches of epigeal invertebrate predators obtained by pitfall traps were compared to absolute population densities estimated by ground photoeclectors in two different habitats, a field and an adjacent set-aside land. In general, abundance of Carabidae and Lycosidae were overestimated by pitfalls, while Staphylinidae and Linyphiidae were underestimated, and beetle larvae showed no obvious trend. The overestimation of Carabidae and Lycosidae by pitfalls had its maximum in spring and summer. Numbers collected by pitfalls did represent actual population densities better in the field than in the set-aside. This is probably caused by the higher vegetation diversity and complexity of the set-aside land which additionally influenced the catches. Pitfalls recovered higher numbers of animals and species, and species composition differed significantly between pitfalls and photoeclectors, in the field as well as in the set-aside. Body size seemed to be the main factor in determining the catch, the relatively larger species being more frequently caught by pitfall traps. In sum, the relationship between pitfall trap catches and actual population densities appeared to be either absent, weak or highly variable among taxa, habitat and time of the season. Thus numbers caught in pitfall traps cannot be considered as reliable indices of “real” abundance nor do they reflect the relative abundance within a given predator community correctly. Therefore, in most cases absolute density estimates should be preferred for the study of epigeal invertebrates in arable land. However, I suggest a combination of both pitfall traps and standardised area samples, because the two approaches possibly provide information of different qualities equally important for the evaluation of epigeal predator species, namely searching activity and population density.},

We generalize the concept of ecological neighborhoods to represent regions of activity or influence during periods of time appropriate to particular ecological processes. Therefore, there is no single ecological neighborhood for any given organism, but rather a number of neighborhoods, each appropriate to different processes. Neighborhood sizes can be estimated by examining the cumulative distribution of activity or influence of an organism as a function of increasingly large spatial units. The spatial and temporal dimensions of neighborhoods provide the scales necessary for assessing environmental patterning relative to particular ecological processes for a given species. Consistent application of the neighborhood concept will assist in the choice of appropriate study units, comparisons among different studies, and comparisons between empirical studies and theoretical postulates.},

  abstract  = {Increasing natural vegetation in agricultural landscapes can create habitat for beneficial organisms such as pollinators and the natural enemies of crop pests. Adding perennial vegetation can also support biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation objectives. However, implementing such changes to agricultural land use across large geographic areas will require a strategic approach. This study examined the amount and distribution of uncultivated areas in Canadian prairie croplands, focusing on Alberta’s agricultural zone (226,543 km2 ). The aim was to identify locations in this region that have potential for increasing non-crop land cover within fields. This assessment was based on a multi-scale model of landscape complexity that described the distribution of land cover as a function of the distance from field centers. It is based on the assumption that the land cover in the field neighborhood is an informative index of how much non-crop area might realistically be maintained or restored in the field itself; i.e., because neighboring lands will reflect the local environmental conditions that support the growth and establishment of non-crop vegetation as well as the likelihood that crop growers will remove areas from production. The model identified variation across the region in land cover distribution, with regions at latitudes between 52 N and 55 N demonstrating the greatest contrasts in the amount of non-crop land between the field and the field neighborhood scale. These findings suggest that there remains capacity for land use decision-makers to optimize the distribution of non-crop land covers in ways the reduce the differences between these scales (i.e., to increase non-crop covers within fields to better represent the neighborhood proportions). Modeling also revealed scale-dependent patterns, such as field margins without crops (400–500 m from field centers) broadly distributed across the region, and evidence that gradients in moisture and temperature have interacted with
land use decisions to shape the proximity of non-crop area to fields.},

Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response variables that are functions (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although methods for analysing function-valued data have been available for several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare.
2. We outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function (‘function regression') and introduce the r package FREE, which focuses on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented, including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on individual-size distributions (ISDs) of fish and trees.
3. No single method performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to combine or compare fitted models.
4. Function regression allows the direct modelling of many function-valued data (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity indices). Our ecological examples using ISD data show that larger rivers support more-even fish-size distributions than smaller rivers and that low initial planting densities lead to more-even tree-size distributions than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than conventional non-function-valued approaches.},

After removing age effects through a novel approach, this study quantifies the effects on tree growth of global change, and assesses the relationship with individual environmental drivers and their relative importance. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were applied to decouple the non-linear effects of age and co-occurring environmental changes on basal area increments (BAI) series, as derived from tree rings in a Pseudotsuga menziesii stand chronosequence of four different age classes (65-, 80-, 100- and 120-year-old). The model could explain about 57% of the overall variation in BAI as a function of age and a selected set of predictors, including water availability in the current summer and at the end of previous growing season; together with age, winter-spring mean temperature was found to be the most important predictor. After accounting for age-related effects, a significant decrease in BAI was observed in Douglas fir over the last decades. No significant impact of atmospheric [CO2] and atmospheric N deposition were detected.},

This paper uses computer simulation and analyses of actual epidemiologic data to explore this underestimation of standard errors. We provide a method for assessing concurvity in data and an alternate class of models that is unaffected by concurvity. We argue that some degree of concurvity is likely to be present in all epidemiologic time series datasets and we explore through the use of meta-analysis the possible impact of concurvity on the existing body of work relating ambient levels of sulfate particles to mortality.},

This phenomenon has occurred in time-series analyses of contemporary data on air pollution and mortality. To evaluate the impact of default implementation of the gam software on published analyses, the authors reanalyzed data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) using three different methods: 1) Poisson regression with parametric nonlinear adjustments for confounding factors; 2) GAM with default convergence parameters; and 3) GAM with more stringent convergence parameters than the default settings.

  abstract = {Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) is a Palearctic generalist predator native to Europe that was introduced to North America in the 1920’s and has since become widespread in the United States. This beetle is non-native to the U.S., yet appears to have little to no negative effect on native carabids and is a critical natural enemy in agricultural systems, especially because it feeds on the invasive gray garden slug Deroceras reticulatum. My thesis begins with a review that compiles in one publication the details of P. melanarius distribution, life history, diet, and factors that influence its populations. I used ecological niche modeling to determine the current potential range of P. melanarius in the United States and found that annual mean temperature and precipitation of the driest month were the most important factors to determine probable habitat suitability. My second chapter investigates the effects of crop rotation and integrated pest management on pests and natural enemies in no-till cropping systems in central Pennsylvania. Overall, I found that diversified rotations that implemented continuous crop cover with perennial forages and cover crops and incorporated IPM enhanced the abundance of natural enemies early in the growing season and can suppress pests to similar levels attained by simple rotations managed with Bt hybrids, pesticidal seed treatments, and prophylactic pesticide application. I also found that protecting and increasing carabid abundance, especially P. melanarius, is important for slug control and can be achieved by reducing tillage, increasing crop species diversity, and using integrated pest management. Lastly, I examined the predator-prey relationship between ground beetles and slugs by investigating non-consumptive effects of P. melanarius on D. reticulatum behavior and physiology. I found that combined physical and chemical cues of P. melanarius induced fear behavior in D. reticulatum that resulted in increased hiding and decreased foraging by D. reticulatum. Due to the ineffectiveness of radioimmunoassays, I could not determine a physiological fear response. Nevertheless, there appear to be non-consumptive effects, which suggest that the pest management value of ground beetle predators such as Pterostichus melanarius may be underestimated in agricultural systems.},

The objective of this study was to quantify the influence of habitat type on the activity and distribution of ground beetles. Over five years, 13,654 ground beetles representing 107 different species were captured. Of these, 14 species represented 85% of the captured beetles. Based on habitat use, we categorized 24 as generalist species, 14 as agricultural species, 12 as grassland species, 39 as prairie specialists, and 19 as woodland species. Tallgrass prairie hosted a significantly more (P < 0.05) diverse assemblage of ground beetles than was found in the other habitats. Prairie also had a higher percentage of habitat specialists in its assemblage than did the less stable agricultural habitats which were dominated by generalists. NMS ordination and indicator species analysis revealed distinct ground beetle assemblages and identified indicator species in the various habitats, allowing species assemblages to be used as habitat indicators.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In order to make agriculture more sustainable it is important to enhance the natural processes supporting crop production, including pollination and pest control. The distance over which these services are delivered into the crop (referred to as spill-over) sets limitations on biodiversity mediated agriculture sustainability. We assess how pest control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies) visitation rates, there was no evidence that yield gain declined with distance from the crop edge. Possibly this was due to honeybees showing no evidence of declining visitation rates with distance into the crop (over 200 m). This contrast with bumblebees, solitary bees and flies which showed evidence of declining visitation rates with distance from the crop edge. Our results suggests that for a typical arable field (c. 12 ha) surrounded by species rich field margins, 50% of the total area could benefit from enhanced pest control services. Increased yields of oilseed rape due to insect pollinators of c. 0.4 t ha-1 were identified, but there was no evidence that field size would limit the spatial distribution of yields. Our results have implications for integrated crop management world-wide through the use of variable dose rate applications technologies that could be used to target pesticides to field centres and so help support biodiversity mediated ecosystem services.},

Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States.},

As a mass-flowering crop grown intensively throughout the Canadian Prairies, canola has the potential to influence pollinator success across tens of thousands of square kilometers of cropland. Bumble bees (Bombus sp.) are efficient pollinators of many types of native and crop plants. We measured the influence of this mass-flowering crop on the abundance and phenology of bumble bees, and on another species of social bee (a sweat bee; Halictus rubicundus), by continuously deploying traps at different levels of canola cultivation intensity, spanning the start and end of canola bloom. Queen bumble bees were more abundant in areas with more canola cover, indicating that this crop is attractive to queens. However, bumble bee workers were significantly fewer in these locations later in the season, suggesting reduced colony success. The median collection dates of workers of three bumble bee species were earlier near canola fields, suggesting a dynamic response of colonies to the increased floral resources. Different species experienced this shift to different extents. The sweat bee was not affected by canola cultivation intensity. Our findings suggest that mass-flowering crops such as canola are attractive to bumble bee queens and therefore may lead to higher rates of colony establishment, but also that colonies established near this crop may be less successful. We propose that the effect on bumble bees can be mitigated by spacing the crop more evenly with respect to alternate floral resources},

In agricultural landscapes, the composition and configuration of cultivated fields and their multi-year dynamics should be considered. But the habitat-matrix paradigm in landscape ecology has resulted in little consideration of cropped areas.

Objectives: The main objective of our study was to determine the influences of spatial and multi-year temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic on carabid beetle assemblages of agricultural landscapes.

Methods: Carabids were sampled in 40 cereal fields in western France, and their species richness, total abundance and abundance of species groups with different dispersal abilities were measured. For each sampling site, we computed different metrics that characterized crop mosaic spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We quantified relationships between carabid assemblages and heterogeneity metrics and tested their significance.

Results: Total carabid abundance increased with increase in temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic. However, all species were not influenced in the same way by spatial and temporal heterogeneity metrics. Some species with high dispersal power such as Trechus quadristriatus were more abundant in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity, whereas the abundance of less mobile species such as Poecilus cupreus were only positively influenced by temporal crop dynamics.

Conclusions: Our results suggest that both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic affects farmland biodiversity, at least for species that use crops during their life cycle or disperse through fields. We highlight the importance of taking this heterogeneity into account in further ecological studies on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.},

The cropping rotation consisted of a spring cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare L., in 2000 and 2001; and wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in 2002), spring dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) 2000–2002, and wheat (T. aestivum), spring in 2000 and 2001, and winter in 2002. A total of 14,480 beetles comprised of 30 species was captured, with five numerically dominant species [Poecilus scitulus L., Poecilus lucublandus Say, Microlestes linearis L., Pterostichus melanarius Ill., and Calosoma cancellatum (Eschscholtz)], accounting for 98% of all captures. All species including the dominants responded idiosyncratically to tillage regimen. Adjusting for trapping biases did not significantly change seasonal activity density of Poecilus spp. or Pt. melanarius to tillage. More beetles were captured in CT than in NT crops because of the dominance of P. scitulus in CT, whereas species richness and biological diversity were generally higher in NT crops. Observed patterns suggest that direct effects of tillage affected some species, whereas indirect effects related to habitat characteristics affected others. CT may provide habitat preferable to xerophilic spring breeders. A relationship was found between beetle species size and tillage regimen in pea and to a lesser extent across all spring crops, with large species (>14 mm) conserved more commonly in NT, small species (<7 mm) in CT, and intermediate species (7–14 mm) conserved equally between tillage systems.},

Landscape data were obtained for eight circular landscape sections around each field (radii 250-2000 m). Multivariate regression models were used to analyze the data. Activity density was highest when the length of strips of grassy road-sides in the surroundings was highest and distance to the next grassy fallow lowest. Body size was negatively related to activity density and to the length of road-side strips and positively to woody areas in the vicinity of the fields. Clutch size was unrelated to any of the landscape factors tested but was positively correlated with female body size. Woody areas and grassy fallow in the close vicinity of the fields had a positive influence on number of offspring per female and total number of offspring. These results indicate that various non-crop components in the landscape surrounding oilseed rape fields can specifically influence the activity density and fitness-related traits of P. agrestis in crops. The possible role of Pardosa spp. in natural pest control is discussed.},

Eggs and adults are vulnerable to predators and parasitoids. In 2009, a series of experiments was undertaken to identify potential indigenous natural enemies of S. lineatus in southern Alberta. In three test arenas, eggs were exposed to starved ground beetles in no‐choice tests for 48 h. Egg debris was observed when eggs were exposed to Bembidion quadrimaculatum L., Microlestes linearis (LeConte), Bembidion rupicola (Kirby), Bembidion timidum (LeConte), Poecilus scitulus LeConte, and staphylinid beetles. Of the two most abundant carabid species, the smaller B. quadrimaculatum consistently removed significantly more eggs (94.6%) than the larger Pterostichus melanarius (17.4%). Similar results were observed in Petri dish and egg card tests. No egg debris was observed in tests with Pt. melanarius . Presence of the larger beetle, Pt. melanarius , resulted in a lower rate of egg removal by the smaller B. quadrimaculatum relative to the rates observed for B. quadrimaculatum alone. Intraguild predation of B. quadrimaculatum by Pt. melanarius was observed in 47% of tests. These results suggest that B. quadrimaculatum is a potential predator of S. lineatus eggs in field pea agroecosystems and should be considered for use in conservation biological control and integrated pest management programs.},

Such spatial heterogeneity results in plants formations that facilitate other species by providing safe sites against predation and physical stress. On the Trnovski gozd plateau in western Slovenia, a secondary habitat of the rare, monotypic endemic umbelliferous species, Hladnikia pastinacifolia, was colonized by a relatively isolated population of the wide spread opilionid species, Phalangium opilio. We hypothesized that in this stony pasture, the impact of the structurally heterogenous vegetation that results from low-intensity grazing benefits both species on hot summer days. For this purpose, we classified vegetation formation types (VFT) and measured temperature and relative humidity in places settled by Ph. opilio individuals during their daily rest. According to the predominant species, we recognized six VFTs: Carlina acaulis, Ruta divaricata, Koeleria pyramidata, Juniperus communis, understory vegetation and grazed turf. Only the spiny C. acaulis and unpalatable R. divaricata facilitated H. pastinacifolia, while also acting as nurse plants. On the other hand, Ph. opilio preferred the understory, but also settled on the other VFTs, except Ruta. During the highest daily temperature of about 38°C, Ph. opilio avoided the grazed turf. Temperature preferences refer to frequencies of individuals rather than to absolute temperature values. The frequencies were independent of sex and the VFTs. Females were more frequently found in tussocks showing higher temperature profiles (Juniperus, Koeleria). During the hot daytime, Ph. opilio was most sensitive to relative humidity, and less so to temperature, whilst the height of settlement varied in adjusting these two environmental factors. The distribution of males significantly differed between the subsequent morning, midday and evening series, but not between the morning and evening ones, while in females it differed between all the three time series. In habitats, such as stony dry pastures, low grazing intensity can maintain persistent populations of H. pastinacifolia and Ph. opilio even in extremely hot weather. Such grazing is the most convenient measure for protecting both species, especially the highly endangered Hladnikia. The major threat to such habitats is afforestation by Pinus nigra, which deserves additional management. We found that in stony pastures, low grazing intensity assures the structural heterogeneity of vegetation required to maintain persistent populations, of both H. pastinacifolia and Ph. opilio.},

  abstract = {Although a great amount of ecological information about harvestmen (Opiliones) exists in the form of quantitative sampling, few attempts have been made to understand their general patterns of occurrences. As a part of the European ‘smallFOREST’-project, which aims to quantify the ecosystem services and biodiversity in small deciduous forest patches in European agricultural landscapes, we investigated harvestmen communities along a latitudinal gradient from west to northeast Europe. The harvestmen were sampled using pitfall traps in 2013. We analysed general patterns of occurrence on three different levels: (1) species richness, abundance and diversity in general, (2) ecological species groups and (3) individual species. We looked at explanatory variables that are working on different scales: latitudinal position, land use intensity in the surrounding landscape (intensive or more extensive), forest age, forest size, location of the traps within the forest (edge or centre) and the direction of the trapping (towards the edge or towards the centre). Harvestman diversity decreases towards the pole. The location within the forest has a large impact since a significant higher amount of harvestmen was found in the forest centres, especially for the species that are bound to the soil. Forest age and forest size had only a limited effect on harvestman occurrences within the sampled ranges. Since no differences in trapping direction were found, we conclude that no migration patterns exist in the sampled period. Further research is needed to understand the influence of land use intensity. A large part of the occurrence patterns might be explained by humidity since most European harvestmen species are hygrophilous and favour/need high humidity levels. Since habitat fragmentation results in smaller forests that house smaller centre areas and soil species are more abundant in the forest centres, they are expected to be the first species that will experience a negative impact.},

  abstract  = {Highlights:
- Landscape complexity was positively associated with crop yields at the district-level in four crops
- Farmers may be able to receive a small crop productivity benefit from enhancing landscape complexity
- Potential negative effects of non-crop land covers (e.g., as pest or weed reservoirs) were not dominant
- Increasing semi-natural vegetation may present few risks for crop productivity in Canadian Prairie annual croplands.

Establishing semi-natural areas within annual croplands can provide habitat for beneficial organisms and ecosystem services to crops through a spillover effect. However, this approach to increasing landscape complexity may have no effect on crops, or it may promote pests, weeds and other disservices that reduce productivity. An argument for changing landscape complexity may be more persuasive if it is associated with higher crop yields. Here, we examine regions that vary in their landscape complexity and, therefore, may also naturally differ in the potential for ecosystem services, disservices and crop yields. Specifically, we examine crop-growing districts in the Canadian province of Alberta to test whether the presence of more non-crop land covers has increased crop yields. Our dataset covered about one-quarter of the seeded area in Canada between 2012 and 2017 consisting of 10,069 records representing average field-level yields reported to a crop insurance provider. In total, we analyzed summary data for 250,000 km2 of seeded area for seven grain crops. Using a functional regression approach, we found evidence for a plausibly positive association between yield and the non-crop land covers found within and near fields in four of seven crops. Landscape complexity, therefore, represented a measurable yield benefit for farmers, although the variance in yield explained by the landscape was small. These findings suggest there may be a low risk of disservices to crops from non-crop land covers in this region. Our study adds support at a broad geographic extent for initiatives that restore perennial and other semi-natural vegetation in annual cropping systems and suggests that, in this temperate grassland region, their promotion (e.g., as carbon stores or as biodiversity refugia) may have no adverse effects for crop production.},

  abstract  = {One potentially important ecosystem service in agricultural fields is the regulation of weeds by carabid beetles, but the effect of agricultural management on the level of regulation has so far been poorly documented. In this study, we monitored weed seed predation rates of Viola arvensis and Capsella bursa-pastoris and carabids from March to September using a grid sampling in two adjacent winter-wheat fields, one in conventional tillage (T) and the other converted to direct drilling with cover-crop for five years (DD). At the field level, weed seed predation was positively correlated to the activity of granivores in the tilled field and was marginally higher in DD than in T during wheat growth. After harvest, granivores and predation rates declined sharply in the cover crop of the DD system whereas they increased in the bare tilled field. This result suggests that the dense cover crop set up after harvest was not suitable for the local pool of autumn-breeding granivores. Spatial aggregations of carabid and predation variables were detected using the MAPCOMP software; these spatial patterns differed between the two management systems and were temporally unstable but consistent over large intervals of spatial resolutions. There were significant spatial associations between trophic guilds and predation rates, i.e. predation rates were positively or negatively associated either to granivores or to omnivores, depending on the time and on the management system. These results highlight the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the level of interactions taking place during a crop cycle, a complexity which explains the important variability in the delivery of ecosystem services such as weed seed predation.},

For 12 of 14 cases showing significant differences between monocultures and intercrops, captures of beetles were highest in canola or pea. These cases primarily reflected different captures of Amara spp. and Bembidion spp. across treatments.

Although there was considerable difference in the composition of species collected with each method, similar trends in overall predator abundance were observed. Generalist predator abundance followed the gradient of ground cover. The treatment with the highest degree of mulch ground cover had the highest overall predator abundance while the treatment which was disked and without surface mulch had the lowest.

  abstract  = {Increasing fragmentation of forests worldwide by timber and industrial development makes it important to understand the edge effects of common anthropogenic disturbances on forest fauna. We collected ground-active spiders along transects across the edge of logging clearcuts, gravel roads and gas pipelines in the boreal forest of Alberta, sampling on the disturbance (10 m from forest edge), and 10, 45, and 200 m into the forest. We asked whether the three disturbances were associated with edge effects on spider communities, and whether the extent of their associated edge effects were equivalent. The spider community at the edges of clearcuts was distinct from interior and on-disturbance communities 10 m into the forest from the clearcut edge, showing an edge effect of between 10 and 45 m from clearcut edges, while no edge effects were apparent at road and pipeline edges. Edge effects therefore differ at linear and non-linear openings in the boreal forest, which suggests that small linear openings may be associated with minimal edge effects compared to large polygonal forest openings. This result has important consequences for forest management, where clearcuts and other non-linear openings are likely to cause edge effects on spider communities that are between 10 and 45 m in their extent. The small size of clearcuts as practiced in the public forests of Canada, and their dense and broad application across the landscape, makes this edge effect of broad spatial significance in protecting biodiversity in managed landscapes.},

Overall, the species diversity of the spider community in the burned areas was not significantly different from the unburned areas for any burn season, although some significant differences occurred within the first year following the burns. Spider abundance decreased following each burn season treatment and the recovery period varied depending on the burn season. Burn season also affected the structure of the spider communities in that the summer and fall burn treatments became dominated by Pardosa distincta (Blackwall) rather than the initially dominant P. moesta Banks.

  abstract  = {Spiders are an abundant and diverse group of generalist predators in arable fields. Knowledge on what landscape and site factors affect this group can be valuable for efforts to reduce biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes and can have implications for natural pest control. We investigated the impact of landscape and site factors on epigeic spiders in 29 winter oilseed rape fields (Brassica napus , OSR) embedded in differently structured landscapes in an agricultural region east of Vienna (Austria). Landscape factors included proportions of non‐crop areas, woody areas and fallows, lengths of road‐side strips and hedges, and landscape diversity at different spatial scales (r=250–2000 m). Site factors included OSR stand density, soil index, soil cultivation intensity, nitrogen fertilisation level, OSR vegetation cover in late autumn, and insecticide applications. Data were analysed using regression, ordination, and variation partitioning. Different characteristics of spider assemblages responded to different landscape factors at different spatial scales. Observed species richness showed the strongest positive reponse to proportions of woody areas at rather small scale (radius 500 m), but the relation remained significant up to the 1250 m radius. Standardised species richness was positively related to non‐crop area at the smallest scale (radius 250 m). Activity density was positively related to length of road‐side strips with maximum effects at large scale (radius 1750 m) and non‐crop area (radius 750 m). Site characteristics (stand density, insecticide applications, and late autumn ground cover) and landscape factors (woody areas and fallows at radius 500 m) were similarly important for explaining species composition. We interpret the scale‐dependency of relations as the result of differences in dispersal power of the studied spider species. These results demonstrate the important, scale dependent influence of natural and semi‐natural habitats on spider assemblages in arable fields.},

Combined effects of landscape context and local placement of agri‐environmental schemes (AES) on natural pest control and within‐field distance functions of natural pest control agents have rarely been addressed but might affect the distribution of biocontrol providers. Importantly, it is currently unknown whether ecosystem services provided by adjacent AES are consistent for different crop types during crop rotation.

In this study, we assessed whether crop rotation from oilseed rape to cereals altered within‐field distance functions of ground‐dwelling predators from adjacent agri‐environmental fields along a gradient in landscape context. Additionally, we recorded crop pests, predation rates, parasitoids as well as crop yields on a total of 30 study sites.

Distance functions varied between trophic levels: Carabid richness decreased while densities of carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles as well as crop yields increased towards the field centres. Distance functions of parasitoids and pests were modulated by the amount of semi‐natural habitat in the surrounding landscape, while the effects of adjacent AES were limited.

Distance decay functions found for ground‐dwelling predators in oilseed rape in the previous year were not always present in cereals. Increasing distance to the field edge also increased effects of crop rotation on carabid beetle assemblages, indicating a source habitat function of field edges.

Synthesis and applications: Distance functions of natural pest control are not universal and the effects of agri‐environmental schemes (AES) in different adjacent crops during crop rotation vary and depend on ecological contrasts. A network of semi‐natural habitats and spatially optimized AES habitats can benefit pest control in agricultural landscapes, but constraints as a result of crop type need to be addressed by annually targeted, spatially shifting agri‐environment schemes for different crops.},

We focus on ground‐dwelling arthropods sampled within orchards in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, South Africa, that do not show a strong association with this habitat type (i.e. ‘non‐cultural’ species), and assess the influence of local (in‐field scale; FLUI) and landscape scale LUI (LLUI), boundary contrast, cover‐crop management, and population effects on species richness, assemblage variation within orchards, and the dissimilarity between assemblages in crop and non‐crop habitats (i.e. ‘cross‐edge dissimilarity’).

Higher LLUI (lower amounts of non‐crop habitat) was associated with higher in‐field species richness but also higher cross‐edge dissimilarity (i.e. these habitats were more distinct in certain landscapes). FLUI was important for non‐cultural species, especially non‐cultural predators and detritivores, for which higher levels of fertilization reduced in‐field species richness. Reduced contrast enhanced in‐field species richness, but there was limited evidence that this enhanced spillover from non‐crop habitats.

Synthesis and applications. In production systems with high border contrast and highly productive crop habitats, higher landscape scale land‐use intensity can enhance in‐field diversity. By supporting a subset of the assemblage able to thrive in both crop and non‐crop habitats, this is contributing to community divergence. To promote farmland diversity, we advocate the reduction of agrochemical inputs, production diversification at the landscapes scale, and the incorporation of a network of non‐crop corridors and stepping‐stone habitats to maintain connectivity and resilience across the landscape.},

  abstract  = {The distribution and abundance of semi-natural and crop habitats within agricultural landscapes is likely to greatly influence population dynamics of ground-dwelling arthropods. We investigated the influence of landscape heterogeneity and composition on the pitfall trap catch of Carabidae, Araneae, and Opiliones in soybean fields. Although we hypothesized that each predator group would increase with landscape heterogeneity and the amount of semi-natural habitat; we found variation in the response of the study organisms. The activity density of Araneae supported our hypothesis, increasing in soybean fields in landscapes with an abundance of forests and grasslands. The diversity of Carabidae in soybean fields increased in landscapes with an abundance of grassland habitat but the activity density of Carabidae declined. This decline was driven extensively by the species Poecilus chalcites which was less abundant in fields located within grassland-rich landscapes. Opiliones declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity but increased within forested landscapes. The spatial scale at which taxa responded to landscape composition also varied. Our hypothesis was that dispersal capacity would influence the spatial scale at which ground-dwelling arthropods responded to landscape structure. We found that Carabidae, which generally disperse by walking, responded to smaller spatial scales than linyphiid spiders, which frequently balloon. However, Lycosidae and Opiliones which also disperse mainly by walking as adults responded at larger spatial scales. These data suggest that understanding taxon-specific relationships to landscape variables should be considered in analyses of arthropod response to landscape structure.},

Five families included 61% of the species reported in field crops: Salticidae (89 spp.), Linyphiidae (78), Araneidae (77), Theridiidae (64), and Lycosidae (62). Considerably more species have been observed in cotton (308 spp.), soybean (262), and alfalfa (233) than in guar (52), rice (75), and grain sorghum (88). Intermediate numbers of species have been observed in peanuts (131), corn (136), and sugarcane (137). The North American spider fauna is estimated at the species level to be 59% web-spinners and 41% wanderers, while those reported from field crops are estimated to be 44% web-spinners and 56% wanderers. These differences may be attributable to guild characteristics associated with dispersal and ability to survive in disturbed habitats. The 42 most frequently occurring spider species were considered in detail and demonstrated that the active wandering guild comprised the largest portion (45%) of this group. Orb-web (21%), sheet-web (19%), ambush-wander (10%), and web-matrix (5%) spiders represented other guilds. The most frequently occurring species in field crops were Oxyopes salticus Hentz (Oxyopidae), Phidippus audax (Hentz) (Salticidae), and Tetragnatha laboriosa Hentz (Araneidae). These three species are prime candidates for augmentation and conservation in field crops or in adjacent habitats as part of a strategy to increase predation on crop pests.},

- Spatiotemporal landscape dynamics lead to tradeoffs in pest density and control.

Declines in functional biodiversity, caused by changing structure and composition of agricultural landscapes, endanger the provision and stability of important ecosystem services, such as biological pest control. Understanding how spatiotemporal landscape changes affect the dynamics of pests, natural enemies and their activity can help safeguard and improve pest control in crops. Here, we tested the influence of spatial and temporal differences in landscape composition of crops (landscape-wide crop rotation diversity and % pest host crops) on the density and seasonal variability of cabbage pests, parasitoids and rates of aphid parasitism and predation. We also tested whether low seasonal variability of pests and parasitoids translates into stable and high pest control, reduced crop damage and higher yields. We show that landscapes with diverse crop rotations increased aphid parasitism, but also leaf-chewing pest density and seasonal stability. Leaf-chewing pest density decreased with increasing % host crops from year to year, suggesting a dilution effect. However, parasitoid density increased in these landscapes. We found no relationship between predation or parasitism and crop damage or yield. Further, stable parasitoid populations led to more stable parasitism rates. These findings highlight that impacts of spatially and temporally changing landscapes are pest- and enemy-specific, and tradeoffs for landscape management may occur. Appropriately managing the diversity and composition of arable crops in farmed landscapes may help influence species occurrences, without converting fertile land to non-crop habitat.},

This remarkable success, however, has come at a great cost. Agriculture is a major cause of global environmental degradation. Malnutrition persists among large sections of the population, and a new epidemic of obesity is on the rise. We review both the successes and failures of the global food system, addressing ongoing debates on pathways to environmental health and food security.

  abstract  = {Pressure to increase food production to meet the demands of a growing human population can make conservation-motivated recommendations to limit agricultural expansion impractical. Therefore, we need to identify conservation actions that can support biodiversity without taking land out of production. Previous studies suggest this can be accomplished by increasing “farmland heterogeneity”—i.e. heterogeneity of the cropped portions of agricultural landscapes—by, for example, decreasing field sizes. However, it is not yet clear whether policies/guidelines that promote farmland heterogeneity will be as effective as those targeting farming practices. Here, we estimated the relative effects of six practices—annual/perennial crop, fertilizer use, herbicide use, insecticide use, tile drainage, and tillage—versus two aspects of farmland heterogeneity—field size and crop diversity—on the diversity of herbaceous plants, woody plants, butterflies, syrphid flies, bees, carabid beetles, spiders, and birds in rural eastern Ontario, Canada. The strength of effect of farming practices and farmland heterogeneity varied among taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, we found important effects of both farming practices and farmland heterogeneity on the combined (multi) diversity across these groups. In particular, we found greater multidiversity in untilled, perennial crop fields than tilled, annual crop fields, and greater multidiversity in agricultural landscapes with smaller crop fields and less diverse crops. The directions of effect of these variables were generally consistent across individual taxonomic groups. For example, richness was lower in landscapes with larger fields and more diverse crops than in landscapes with smaller fields and less diverse crops for all taxa except spiders. The negative effect of crop diversity on multidiversity and the richness of most of the studied taxa indicates that this aspect of farmland heterogeneity does not necessarily benefit wildlife species. Nevertheless, a compelling implication of this study is that it suggests that policies/guidelines aimed at reducing crop field sizes would be at least as effective for conservation of biodiversity within working agricultural landscapes as those designed to promote a wildlife-friendly farming practice.},

  abstract  = {An important goal of ecological compensation measures in agricultural areas is the conservation and enhancement of regional species diversity. However, some current European agri-environment schemes seem to be rather ineffective. A likely explanation is the lack of source populations in intensely cultivated landscapes. Remnants of natural and seminatural habitats can contribute to regional biodiversity in various ways: as essential habitats for specialised species, as stepping stones, and as temporary habitats for hibernation, larval development, or preovipository feeding.

The overall percentage of arthropod species, for which seminatural habitats are an essential prerequisite for living in an agricultural landscape, was assessed with a 5 km long transect of 18 standardised trapping stations. The transect extended from an isolated area of wetland through intensely managed crop fields and grassland to an isolated semiarid meadow bordered by mixed forest.

For more than 1000 arthropod species the spatial and temporal distribution of a one year's catch along the transect was interpreted with regard to their affinity to seminatural habitats. Experts were asked to judge questionable cases of apparent ubiquist species.

All in all, more than 63% of all animal species (except for soil and water fauna) living in the agriculturally managed areas of the Limpach valley seem to depend on the presence of seminatural habitats. We conclude that remnant islands of natural or seminatural habitats provide the most important source populations for agri-environment schemes in order to enhance biodiversity in an otherwise depleted agricultural landscape.},

Arthropods moving through these landscapes encounter a range of edges, with different permeability. Patches of native vegetation in these landscapes may support natural enemies of crop pests by providing alternate hosts for parasitic wasps and/or acting as a source for predatory insects. We test this by quantifying species interactions and measuring movement across different edge-types. A high diversity of parasitoid species used hosts in the native vegetation patches, however we recorded few instances of the same parasitoid species using hosts in both the native vegetation and the crop (canola). However, we did find overall greater densities of parasitoids moving from native vegetation into the crop. Of the parasitoid groups examined, parasitoids of aphids (Braconidae: Aphidiinae) frequently moved from native vegetation into canola. In contrast, parasitoids of caterpillars (Braconidae: Microgastrinae) moved commonly from cereal fields into canola. Late season samples showed both aphids and parasitoids moving frequently out of native vegetation, in contrast predators moved less commonly from native vegetation (across the whole season). The season-long net advantage or disadvantage of native vegetation for pest control services is therefore difficult to evaluate. It appears that the different edge-types alter movement patterns of natural enemies more so than herbivorous pest species, and this may impact pest control services.},

We do not yet have data on the interactions between pollination and pest‐control services. However, we do have data on the distributions of pollinators and natural enemies in agroecosystems. Therefore, we compared these two groups of ecosystem service providers, to see if the management of farms and agricultural landscapes might have similar effects on the abundance and richness of both. In a meta‐analysis, we compared 46 studies that sampled bees, predatory beetles, parasitic wasps, and spiders in fields, orchards, or vineyards of food crops. These studies used the proximity or proportion of non‐crop or natural habitats in the landscapes surrounding these crops (a measure of landscape complexity), or the proximity or diversity of non‐crop plants in the margins of these crops (a measure of local complexity), to explain the abundance or richness of these beneficial arthropods. Compositional complexity at both landscape and local scales had positive effects on both pollinators and natural enemies, but different effects on different taxa. Effects on bees and spiders were significantly positive, but effects on parasitoids and predatory beetles (mostly Carabidae and Staphylinidae) were inconclusive. Landscape complexity had significantly stronger effects on bees than it did on predatory beetles and significantly stronger effects in non‐woody rather than in woody crops. Effects on richness were significantly stronger than effects on abundance, but possibly only for spiders. This abundance‐richness difference might be caused by differences between generalists and specialists, or between arthropods that depend on non‐crop habitats (ecotone species and dispersers) and those that do not (cultural species). We call this the ‘specialist‐generalist’ or ‘cultural difference’ mechanism. If complexity has stronger effects on richness than abundance, it might have stronger effects on the stability than the magnitude of these arthropod‐mediated ecosystem services. We conclude that some pollinators and natural enemies seem to have compatible responses to complexity, and it might be possible to manage agroecosystems for the benefit of both. However, too few studies have compared the two, and so we cannot yet conclude that there are no negative interactions between pollinators and natural enemies, and no trade‐offs between pollination and pest‐control services. Therefore, we suggest a framework for future research to bridge these gaps in our knowledge.},

Field margins can serve as nesting and foraging habitats for wild bees and can be a source of pollinators. Regional differences in pollinator community composition may affect this spill-over of bees. We studied how regional and local differences affect the spatial distribution of wild bee species richness, activity-density and body size in crop fields. We sampled bees both from the field centre and at two different types of semi-natural field margins, grass strips and hedges, in 12 strawberry fields. The fields were distributed over four regions in Northern Europe, representing an almost 1100 km long north-south gradient. Even over this gradient, daytime temperatures during sampling did not differ significantly between regions and did therefore probably not impact bee activity. Bee species richness was higher in field margins compared with field centres independent of field size. However, there was no difference between centre and margin in body-size or activity-density. In contrast, bee activity-density increased towards the southern regions, whereas the mean body size increased towards the north. In conclusion, our study revealed a general pattern across European regions of bee diversity, but not activity-density, declining towards the field interior which suggests that the benefits of functional diversity of pollinators may be difficult to achieve through spill-over effects from margins to crop. We also identified dissimilar regional patterns in bee diversity and activity-density, which should be taken into account in conservation management.},

  abstract  = {Coexistence in bumblebee communities has largely been investigated at local spatial scales. However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250--3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in conservation schemes.},

  abstract  = {Landscape structure influences local diversity and ecosystem processes, including cross-habitat fluxes of organisms coupling the dynamics of different habitats. The flow of organisms across system boundaries is known to occur between different natural habitats as well as across the crop—noncrop interface. Several studies show how field boundaries can enhance predator populations invading arable crops and controlling pest populations. However, generalist arthropods may also spill over from land-use systems to natural areas (mainly grassland) modifying interactions therein. A view of land-use systems as sources and natural habitats as sinks is consistent with the idea that the direction of the organisms' fluxes is from high to low productivity systems, while noncrop habitats are important sources for recolonization of arable fields after they are cleared for harvest. From the perspective of landscape management, enhancement of population exchanges between crop and noncrop areas may include beneficial as well as unwelcome interactions.},

  abstract  = {Many agroecosystems are unfavorable environments for natural enemies due to high levels of disturbance. Habitat management, a form of conservation biological control, is an ecologically based approach aimed at favoring natural enemies and enhancing biological control in agricultural systems. The goal of habitat management is to create a suitable ecological infrastructure within the agricultural landscape to provide resources such as food for adult natural enemies, alternative prey or hosts, and shelter from adverse conditions. These resources must be integrated into the landscape in a way that is spatially and temporally favorable to natural enemies and practical for producers to implement. The rapidly expanding literature on habitat management is reviewed with attention to practices for favoring predators and parasitoids, implementation of habitat management, and the contributions of modeling and ecological theory to this developing area of conservation biological control. The potential to integrate the goals of habitat management for natural enemies and nature conservation is discussed.},

  abstract  = {Summary The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

  abstract  = {The coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the proportion of variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called Inline Formula for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},
