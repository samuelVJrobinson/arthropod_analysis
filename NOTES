Driving questions:

- Do certain landscape features act as refugia for benefical arthropods? What types of arthropods live where?
- Do arthropods spill over into crop fields from non-crop areas? How far does this extend?

Hypothesis:
- Non-crop areas are not disturbed (as frequently) as cropland, acting as suitable egg-laying and feeding sites
- Crop areas are disturbed (egg-laying not as successful), but act as feeding sites because pest insects aggregate to them
Preditions:
- Predatory arthropod abundance will be high in non-crop areas and low in crop areas
  - Specifically, abundance will be higher in areas with abundance (nearby) non-crop area

Other notes:
- Seems like pitfall traps are not a good measure of density, by themselves. Sampling radius depends on time, ground cover, etc.

  - However, there are methods to address this, namely 2-trap method:

- P. melanarius adults found in fields, larvae found in margins: possibly reproduction in margins and feeding in fields?

  - Tend to prefer hedges/field margins(?) - this paper is poorly written, so it's hard to tell

  - They eat slugs, no-till and diverse rotation increases abundance:
