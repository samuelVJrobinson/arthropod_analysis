Questions for Paul/Hailey:

1) What do the aliasBLID1 and aliasBLID2 columns of trap dataframe mean? Are these BLIDs that share the same location? If so, why not just merge the BLIDs into be a single BLID?

2) Were yellow, blue, white used in all combination of "Coloured cups"? Are we interested in different colours of coloured cups at all?
