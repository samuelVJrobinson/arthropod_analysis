# arthropod_analysis
Analysis of landscape and wetland arthropod data for Paul Galpern, using data from 2015-2018.
Main goals: 
- Use in-field data to estimate how insect abundance declines into fields away from features
- Identify which features provide best conservation value (richness)
- Identify which features provide best potential ecosystem service (predator abundance)\
Secondary goals:
- Identify drivers of abundance/richness using radial regression (functional data analysis)
